# B. Segregate the Data for Bihar, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh.
#   3.Is there a variable in this data set that is correlated with whether an area will have 
#     a high number of households where the Census house will be in poor/Dilapidated condition?
#     How strong/reliable would a relation of these variables be?
#     Discuss your intuition with the results.(Hint: You could start with a correlation matrix)
